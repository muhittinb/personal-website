When a wind turbine is cyclically loaded by wind or wave, the pile foundation distributes stress to the granular material. This loading condition leads to the permanent deformation of foundation material, and eventually, the pile head shifts. Prediction of permanent displacement of the pile mainly depends on the understanding of the behavior of granular material where the pile is embedded in.
